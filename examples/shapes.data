This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.

	compiling :

	if you wish to compile the library all you have to do is create a new file with this in it

	rgfw.c
	#define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION
	#include "RGFW.h"

	then you can use gcc (or whatever compile you wish to use) to compile the library into object file

	ex. gcc -c RGFW.c -fPIC

	after you compile the library into an object file, you can also turn the object file into an static or shared library

	(commands ar and gcc can be replaced with whatever equivalent your system uses)
	static : ar rcs RGFW.a RGFW.o
	shared :
		windows:
			gcc -shared RGFW.o -lopengl32 -lshell32 -lgdi32 -o RGFW.dll
		linux:
			gcc -shared RGFW.o -lX11 -lXcursor -lGL -o RGFW.so

   Do this:
      #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
   before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the implementation.

   // i.e. it should look like this:
   #include ...
   #include ...
   #include ...
   #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
   #include "stb_image.h"

   You can #define STBI_ASSERT(x) before the #include to avoid using assert.h.
   And #define STBI_MALLOC, STBI_REALLOC, and STBI_FREE to avoid using malloc,realloc,free


   QUICK NOTES:
      Primarily of interest to game developers and other people who can
          avoid problematic images and only need the trivial interface

      JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
      PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel

      TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
      BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
      PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)

      GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
      HDR (radiance rgbE format)
      PIC (Softimage PIC)
      PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

      Animated GIF still needs a proper API, but here's one way to do it:
          http://gist.github.com/urraka/685d9a6340b26b830d49

      - decode from memory or through FILE (define STBI_NO_STDIO to remove code)
      - decode from arbitrary I/O callbacks
      - SIMD acceleration on x86/x64 (SSE2) and ARM (NEON)

#ifndef STBI_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_H
#define STBI_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_H

// DOCUMENTATION
//
// Limitations:
//    - no 12-bit-per-channel JPEG
//    - no JPEGs with arithmetic coding
//    - GIF always returns *comp=4
//
// Basic usage (see HDR discussion below for HDR usage):
//    int x,y,n;
//    unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
//    // ... process data if not NULL ...
//    // ... x = width, y = height, n = # 8-bit components per pixel ...
//    // ... replace '0' with '1'..'4' to force that many components per pixel
//    // ... but 'n' will always be the number that it would have been if you said 0
//    stbi_image_free(data)
//
// Standard parameters:
//    int *x                 -- outputs image width in pixels
//    int *y                 -- outputs image height in pixels
//    int *channels_in_file  -- outputs # of image components in image file
//    int desired_channels   -- if non-zero, # of image components requested in result
//
// The return value from an image loader is an 'unsigned char *' which points
// to the pixel data, or NULL on an allocation failure or if the image is
// corrupt or invalid. The pixel data consists of *y scanlines of *x pixels,
// with each pixel consisting of N interleaved 8-bit components; the first
// pixel pointed to is top-left-most in the image. There is no padding between
// image scanlines or between pixels, regardless of format. The number of
// components N is 'desired_channels' if desired_channels is non-zero, or
// *channels_in_file otherwise. If desired_channels is non-zero,
// *channels_in_file has the number of components that _would_ have been
// output otherwise. E.g. if you set desired_channels to 4, you will always
// get RGBA output, but you can check *channels_in_file to see if it's trivially
// opaque because e.g. there were only 3 channels in the source image.
//
// An output image with N components has the following components interleaved
// in this order in each pixel:
//
//     N=#comp     components
//       1           grey
//       2           grey, alpha
//       3           red, green, blue
//       4           red, green, blue, alpha
//
// If image loading fails for any reason, the return value will be NULL,
// and *x, *y, *channels_in_file will be unchanged. The function
// stbi_failure_reason() can be queried for an extremely brief, end-user
// unfriendly explanation of why the load failed. Define STBI_NO_FAILURE_STRINGS
// to avoid compiling these strings at all, and STBI_FAILURE_USERMSG to get slightly
// more user-friendly ones.
//
// Paletted PNG, BMP, GIF, and PIC images are automatically depalettized.
//
// To query the width, height and component count of an image without having to
// decode the full file, you can use the stbi_info family of functions:
//
//   int x,y,n,ok;
//   ok = stbi_info(filename, &x, &y, &n);
//   // returns ok=1 and sets x, y, n if image is a supported format,
//   // 0 otherwise.
//
// Note that stb_image pervasively uses ints in its public API for sizes,
// including sizes of memory buffers. This is now part of the API and thus
// hard to change without causing breakage. As a result, the various image
// loaders all have certain limits on image size; these differ somewhat
// by format but generally boil down to either just under 2GB or just under
// 1GB. When the decoded image would be larger than this, stb_image decoding
// will fail.
//
// Additionally, stb_image will reject image files that have any of their
// dimensions set to a larger value than the configurable STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS,
// which defaults to 2**24 = 16777216 pixels. Due to the above memory limit,
// the only way to have an image with such dimensions load correctly
// is for it to have a rather extreme aspect ratio. Either way, the
// assumption here is that such larger images are likely to be malformed
// or malicious. If you do need to load an image with individual dimensions
// larger than that, and it still fits in the overall size limit, you can
// #define STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS on your own to be something larger.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// UNICODE:
//
//   If compiling for Windows and you wish to use Unicode filenames, compile
//   with
//       #define STBI_WINDOWS_UTF8
//   and pass utf8-encoded filenames. Call stbi_convert_wchar_to_utf8 to convert
//   Windows wchar_t filenames to utf8.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// Philosophy
//
// stb libraries are designed with the following priorities:
//
//    1. easy to use
//    2. easy to maintain
//    3. good performance
//
// Sometimes I let "good performance" creep up in priority over "easy to maintain",
// and for best performance I may provide less-easy-to-use APIs that give higher
// performance, in addition to the easy-to-use ones. Nevertheless, it's important
// to keep in mind that from the standpoint of you, a client of this library,
// all you care about is #1 and #3, and stb libraries DO NOT emphasize #3 above all.
//
// Some secondary priorities arise directly from the first two, some of which
// provide more explicit reasons why performance can't be emphasized.
//
//    - Portable ("ease of use")
//    - Small source code footprint ("easy to maintain")
//    - No dependencies ("ease of use")
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// I/O callbacks
//
// I/O callbacks allow you to read from arbitrary sources, like packaged
// files or some other source. Data read from callbacks are processed
// through a small internal buffer (currently 128 bytes) to try to reduce
// overhead.
//
// The three functions you must define are "read" (reads some bytes of data),
// "skip" (skips some bytes of data), "eof" (reports if the stream is at the end).
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// SIMD support
//
// The JPEG decoder will try to automatically use SIMD kernels on x86 when
// supported by the compiler. For ARM Neon support, you must explicitly
// request it.
//
// (The old do-it-yourself SIMD API is no longer supported in the current
// code.)
//
// On x86, SSE2 will automatically be used when available based on a run-time
// test; if not, the generic C versions are used as a fall-back. On ARM targets,
// the typical path is to have separate builds for NEON and non-NEON devices
// (at least this is true for iOS and Android). Therefore, the NEON support is
// toggled by a build flag: define STBI_NEON to get NEON loops.
//
// If for some reason you do not want to use any of SIMD code, or if
// you have issues compiling it, you can disable it entirely by
// defining STBI_NO_SIMD.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// HDR image support   (disable by defining STBI_NO_HDR)
//
// stb_image supports loading HDR images in general, and currently the Radiance
// .HDR file format specifically. You can still load any file through the existing
// interface; if you attempt to load an HDR file, it will be automatically remapped
// to LDR, assuming gamma 2.2 and an arbitrary scale factor defaulting to 1;
// both of these constants can be reconfigured through this interface:
//
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_gamma(2.2f);
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_scale(1.0f);
//
// (note, do not use _inverse_ constants; stbi_image will invert them
// appropriately).
//
// Additionally, there is a new, parallel interface for loading files as
// (linear) floats to preserve the full dynamic range:
//
//    float *data = stbi_loadf(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
//
// If you load LDR images through this interface, those images will
// be promoted to floating point values, run through the inverse of
// constants corresponding to the above:
//
//     stbi_ldr_to_hdr_scale(1.0f);
//     stbi_ldr_to_hdr_gamma(2.2f);
//
// Finally, given a filename (or an open file or memory block--see header
// file for details) containing image data, you can query for the "most
// appropriate" interface to use (that is, whether the image is HDR or
// not), using:
//
//     stbi_is_hdr(char *filename);
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// iPhone PNG support:
//
// We optionally support converting iPhone-formatted PNGs (which store
// premultiplied BGRA) back to RGB, even though they're internally encoded
// differently. To enable this conversion, call
// stbi_convert_iphone_png_to_rgb(1).
//
// Call stbi_set_unpremultiply_on_load(1) as well to force a divide per
// pixel to remove any premultiplied alpha *only* if the image file explicitly
// says there's premultiplied data (currently only happens in iPhone images,
// and only if iPhone convert-to-rgb processing is on).
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
//
//  - You can suppress implementation of any of the decoders to reduce
//    your code footprint by #defining one or more of the following
//    symbols before creating the implementation.
//
//        STBI_NO_JPEG
//        STBI_NO_PNG
//        STBI_NO_BMP
//        STBI_NO_PSD
//        STBI_NO_TGA
//        STBI_NO_GIF
//        STBI_NO_HDR
//        STBI_NO_PIC
//        STBI_NO_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)
//
//  - You can request *only* certain decoders and suppress all other ones
//    (this will be more forward-compatible, as addition of new decoders
//    doesn't require you to disable them explicitly):
//
//        STBI_ONLY_JPEG
//        STBI_ONLY_PNG
//        STBI_ONLY_BMP
//        STBI_ONLY_PSD
//        STBI_ONLY_TGA
//        STBI_ONLY_GIF
//        STBI_ONLY_HDR
//        STBI_ONLY_PIC
//        STBI_ONLY_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)
//
//   - If you use STBI_NO_PNG (or _ONLY_ without PNG), and you still
//     want the zlib decoder to be available, #define STBI_SUPPORT_ZLIB
//
//  - If you define STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS, stb_image will reject images greater
//    than that size (in either width or height) without further processing.
//    This is to let programs in the wild set an upper bound to prevent
//    denial-of-service attacks on untrusted data, as one could generate a
//    valid image of gigantic dimensions and force stb_image to allocate a
//    huge block of memory and spend disproportionate time decoding it. By
//    default this is set to (1 << 24), which is 16777216, but that's still
//    very big.
